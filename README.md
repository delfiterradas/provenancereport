## Introduction

**nf-core/provenancereport** is a reporting pipeline that validates a samplesheet and renders reproducible Quarto reports. The samplesheet has two columns, `id` and `path`, where each row points to one input file. The pipeline stages all listed files into a single Quarto render and publishes the rendered report plus any generated artifacts.

The default workflow performs the following steps:

1. Validate and normalise the input samplesheet with `nf-schema`.
2. Resolve each `path` entry from the samplesheet as one input file.
3. Render one Quarto notebook with all listed files using the nf-core `quartonotebook` module.
4. Calculate MD5 checksums for every samplesheet input and the rendered Quarto HTML using the nf-core `md5sum` module.
5. Run a local environment collector in the same `--report_container` image as Quarto and generate a MultiQC audit report containing the input samplesheet, file checksums, run configuration, software versions, container reference, and R/Python runtime information.
6. Publish the reports, artifacts, checksums, and standard Nextflow execution metadata.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/get_started/environment_setup/overview) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/get_started/run-your-first-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
id,path
counts,counts.tsv
metadata,metadata.tsv
```

Each row represents exactly one input file. The `id` value is included in `params$input_ids`, and `path` must point to a single file.

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/provenancereport \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

By default, the pipeline renders the bundled notebook in `assets/provenance_report.qmd`. To render your own custom Quarto notebook, provide `--notebook custom_report.qmd`.

Report inputs are staged into the Quarto render working directory by basename. Custom notebooks should read those staged filenames directly, for example `readxl::read_xlsx("counts.xlsx")`, and every file listed in the samplesheet must have a unique basename. See the usage documentation for details on designing custom reports.

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/running/run-pipelines#using-parameter-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/provenancereport/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/provenancereport/parameters).
